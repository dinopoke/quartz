It hops onto a hero and then hops to another tile away. If another hero is within range, it chains and hops onto that hero instead. When it lands, the rat does a ranged attack which can be avoided by a QTE.\n\nThe toad cannot hop onto adjacent tiles. Instead, the toad can slurp to reduce the player's attack.\n\n## Toad\nThe toad hops around with a shorter range. It will try to tongue one of the heroes. When a hero is tongued, it is dragged straight to the toad. On the next attack. the toad will jump and damage heroes adjacent, knock them back and stun them. The rat can be tongued to get back onto the toad.

Only has X (2 or so?) hops per turn. - Facing direction matters, so turning around takes one of their hops. - For now, only left and right facing. - If possible in future, facing up and down too? - Or just keep it left and right, to avoid visibility issues, and reduce work?  \n    - Standing behind him means he cant attack you (*see refight variations) - Unless maybe he hops backwards on top of you? - The Rider can't swing at you either, so he'll just glare at you and angrily wave his hand in the air, yelling \"!?#@!\"  \n    - Standing parallel (up or down 1-2 tiles?) to him means the rider can whack you  \n    - Standing infront of him, the Rider can jab his weapon ahead and hit you. - The Toad might also use lick attacks on you.\n    \n2.  _[_2:05 PM_]_\n    \n    ### SPECIAL ATTACKS ### - Toad uses his tonuge to pull your characters closer, and the rider follows up with a melee attack  \n    - Toad uses his tongue to wrap one of your player characters, binding them for a turn. - If the other character attacks the extended tongue, it frees them and makes the toad real up on its hind legs in pain - If the rider is unstable, he'll fall off at this point, else he holds on. - Failing to attack the tongue and free them from the wrap, the toad eats them and deals damage, before spitting them out for extra damage  \n    - Rider has a 2 range weapon of some sort, a metal pipe / shoddily crafted scavenger spear?  \n    - Rider also can throw bombs of some sort? - Needs a cue or predicatble reason to do so though, IE if players are standing in a group?\n    \n3.  _[_2:05 PM_]_\n    \n    ### SEPARATING THE RIDER ### - Rider can use a choreographed charge up attack, swinging his weapon in a wide arc - which leaves him noticably unstable for a turn or so - In this state, he can be knocked off, such as via the prior mentioned hitting the toads tongue attack  \n    - Upon falling off, the Rider bounces / rolls 3-5 tiles or so away, intentionally making a gap between the Rider and the Toad - Rider is stunned for a period, to let you wail on him for a bit - Afterwards, he tries to make it back to his Toad, where you can stand in the way and engage him in combat (*See refight variants)\n    \n4.  _[_2:05 PM_]_\n    \n    ### PLAYER TACTICS ### - The Toad may have a lot of health, but killing it leaves the Rider vulnerable and unable to get back on the Toad - If you kill the Toad when the Rider is on him, he falls off, maybe being stunned for a turn as he can't get to his feet? - The Rider could get angry that you killed his Toad, and enter an enranged / panicked state  \n    - If you separate the Rider from the Toad, and kill the Rider, the Toad won't bother fighting back, and will just leave. (*see refight variations)  \n    - There's a choice in strategies: - Try to focus the Toad so the Rider cant get back on and is left alone? - Or try to focus the Rider, taking damage from both targets, but potentially ending the fight earlier? - Let the Rider get back to his Toad, where he wont really attack you unless you stand in his way - Or intercept the Rider so he cant get back to his Toad, but he will attack you in return\n    \n5.  _[_2:05 PM_]_\n    \n    ### REFIGHT VARIATIONS ### - A posion Toad that spews poison, covering some of the tiles infront of him in poison, which could affect the players tactics - Tongue and eat attacks would probably also be buffed to inflict poison, getting eaten especially.  \n    - An armoured Toad, that has a armoured behind, s either cant take damage from behind, or is greatly reduced. - This reduces the chance of killing the toad on its own, without knocking off the Rider.  \n    - Giving the Rider a different weapon - A gun / ranged weapon?  \n    - A cowardly Rookie Rider vs a Trained Confident Rider - Affects how they act when knocked off the Toad: - Type A: Cowardly means he'll try to avoid confronting the player, and try to circle around to quickly get back to their Toad ASAP, where they feel safe. - Type B: Confident means they'll try to barrel through the player, to get to their Toad, attacking the player if they're in the way - Type C: Maybe even another variant of Rider, who intentionally gets off his Toad, and goes in for the fight, not even bothering to get to their toad (maybe only after a couple of turns of combat) - Would be cool if they had combo attacks with their Toad partner  \n    - A well trained Toad that continues to fight even after his Rider dies?","lastmodified":"2022-06-01T13:27:54.956737157Z","tags":null},"/Tragedy-Looper":{"title":"Tragedy Looper","content":"\n# Tragedy Looper\nCreated: 2022-05-08 17:11  \n\nIt‚Äôs like an anime where the protagonists are stuck in a time loop where a tragedy always keeps happening. The protagonists need to find out what it is and prevent it within a certain number of loops while the mastermind tries to keep one step ahead and throw them off the scent. Sounds familiar?\n\n## References\n1. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-01T13:27:54.956737157Z","tags":null},"/Ultimate-Toolbox":{"title":"Ultimate Toolbox","content":"# Ultimate Toolbox\nCreated: 2022-05-04 16:41\n\n[Local PDF Link](\u003cG:\\My Drive\\Gam\\Tabletop\\Role Playing Games\\Solo\\ultimate-toolbox.pdf\u003e)\n\n\n## References\n1. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-01T13:27:54.956737157Z","tags":null},"/Web-Comics":{"title":"Web Comics","content":"# Web Comics  \n\n[[Literature]]\n\n- [http://achewood.com/](http://achewood.com/)\n- [http://harkavagrant.com/](http://harkavagrant.com/)\n- [http://threewordphrase.com/](http://threewordphrase.com/)\n- [http://www.qwantz.com/index.php](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php)\n- [http://pbfcomics.com/](http://pbfcomics.com/)\n- [http://xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com)\n- [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)","lastmodified":"2022-06-01T13:27:54.956737157Z","tags":null}}
